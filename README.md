# Predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) for Targeted Retention Campaigns

**Overview:**

This project focuses on customer segmentation for a retail business to optimize marketing spend and improve customer retention rates.  It leverages customer transaction data to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) and subsequently segments customers into distinct groups based on their predicted CLTV. This segmentation allows for the creation of targeted retention campaigns, focusing resources on high-value customers while optimizing marketing efficiency. The analysis involves data preprocessing, CLTV prediction using appropriate models (details within the code), and visualization of key findings.

**Technologies Used:**

* Python 3
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


**How to Run:**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. **Run the main script:** `python main.py`

**Example Output:**

The script will print key findings to the console, including summary statistics of the CLTV predictions and details about the customer segments created.  Additionally, the project generates several visualization files (e.g., `cltv_distribution.png`, `segment_comparison.png`) which illustrate the CLTV distribution and the characteristics of each customer segment. These files will be saved in the project's directory.  The specific visualizations generated may vary depending on the chosen CLTV model and analysis parameters.


**Project Structure:**

* `data/`: Contains the input data (replace with your own data).
* `src/`: Contains the source code for the project.
* `main.py`: Main script to run the analysis.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the project's dependencies.
* `results/`:  Folder to save output visualizations (created during execution).


**Further Development:**

Future improvements could include exploring alternative CLTV prediction models, incorporating additional customer data features (e.g., demographics, website activity), and implementing A/B testing frameworks to evaluate the effectiveness of the targeted retention campaigns.
